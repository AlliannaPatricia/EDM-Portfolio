# EDM Portfolio
This portfolio shows my skills in data cleaning, organizing, and analyzing using Microsoft Excel and MySQL Workbench. Through lab activities, I learned how to prepare data correctly for reports and decision-making. In Excel, I practiced removing duplicates, fixing errors, using formulas, and creating charts to understand data better. In MySQL Workbench, I created tables and wrote SQL queries like SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY to manage and retrieve data. These tools helped me improve how I handle and understand data. This portfolio reflects my growth as an Information Systems student.
## About Me 
- Hi! I’m Allianna Patricia David, a 1st-year BS Information Systems student. I’m interested in how technology and data work together to solve problems. I’ve been learning to use Microsoft Excel and MySQL Workbench to organize, clean, and analyze data. In Excel, I practiced fixing errors and using formulas. In MySQL, I created databases, built tables, and wrote SQL queries. These tools helped me understand how data is managed and connected. I’m excited to keep learning and building a strong foundation for my future in tech.
