# EDM Portfolio
This portfolio shows my skills in data cleaning, organizing, and analyzing using Excel. Through different lab activities, I have learned how to make data clear, correct, and easy to use. These activities helped me improve my skills in fixing errors, sorting data, and preparing information for analysis.
