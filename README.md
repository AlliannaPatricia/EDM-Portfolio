# EDM Portfolio
This portfolio shows my skills in data cleaning, organizing, and analyzing using Microsoft Excel and MySQL Workbench. Through lab activities, I learned how to prepare data correctly for reports and decision-making. In Excel, I practiced removing duplicates, fixing errors, using formulas, and creating charts to understand data better. In MySQL Workbench, I created tables and wrote SQL queries like SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY to manage and retrieve data. These tools helped me improve how I handle and understand data. This portfolio reflects my growth as an Information Systems student.
